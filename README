This is an example of a binary modification where the value of an
internal variable is updated every time the binary is executed.
The program does not work on platforms that enforce stringent
code signing (viz. macOS). Code has been tested in WSL running
Ubuntu 20.04.3 (gcc 9.3.0). 

To build:
	$ make

To test:
	$ ./test.out

Every time test.out runs, the internal variable, which starts
out at 100, is incremented by a random amount between 10 and 100.
